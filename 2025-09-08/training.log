Morning meeting completed

Regex concepts and methods â€“ Task: longrealty_2025_09_05.json

Detailed study of Regex:

Hands-on practice in Sublime Text (regex search, replace, unique line checking)

Applied Regex on CSV & JSON datasets (field extraction, validation)

Validated formats: emails, phone numbers, dates, numerical fields

Practiced Regex methods: match, search, findall, sub

Tested grouping, optional matches, alternation

Installed & explored MongoDB Compass (GUI tool):

Connected via mongodb://localhost:27017

Browsed databases & collections visually

Practiced querying with filter bar (e.g., { "status": "active" })

Explored Schema visualization for field structures & data types

Performed CRUD operations (insert, update, delete) directly in Compass

Used Aggregation Pipeline Builder: $match, $group, $sort, $project

Learned data import/export (JSON/CSV) for QA validation

Checked indexing & performance insights for queries
